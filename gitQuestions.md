## V. Scenario-Based / Problem Solving

48. You've made several commits on your feature branch, but now realize the first commit had a typo in its message. How would you correct it without affecting subsequent commits, assuming you haven't pushed the branch yet?

49. You're working on a feature branch, and the `main` branch has received critical bug fixes. How would you incorporate those bug fixes into your feature branch without merging your feature branch into `main` prematurely?

50. Your colleague pushed a change that broke the build. How would you quickly revert their change and get the build working again, without losing their work entirely?

51. You have untracked files and some staged changes, but you need to immediately switch to another branch to fix a hotfix. What Git command would you use to temporarily save your current work?

52. Describe a time you encountered a complex merge conflict. How did you resolve it? What tools or strategies did you use?

53. How do you ensure your local `main` branch is always up-to-date with the `main` branch on GitHub?
